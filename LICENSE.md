## **1. Grant of License**

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person (the "User") obtaining a copy of this software (the "Software"), to use, modify, and distribute the Software, subject to the following conditions:

### **1.1 Code Use**

You can only use our source code for public mods if you get permission from **@yajat_kaul** himself.  
You can only use the **Showdown Changes** if you get permission from **@treynamitv**.

### **1.2 Commercial Use**

The use of any part of the Mega Showdown Software—including but not limited to code, assets, textures, models, or derivatives thereof—for any **commercial purpose** is **strictly prohibited**.  
This includes, without limitation:

- Selling or licensing the Software or its components;
- Using the Software or its components in paid mods, paid access content, or premium features;
- Locking any content derived from the Software (such as skins, textures, or features) behind paywalls, donation rewards, server crate keys, or other monetized systems.

Commercial use is defined as any activity that results in **direct or indirect financial gain**, whether monetary or in-kind (e.g., donations, subscriptions, ad revenue, or exclusive access).  
Any exception must be explicitly authorized in writing by **Yajat Kaul**.

#### **1.2.1 Commercial Server Usage**

Any **server**—public or private—that intends to use Mega Showdown or any part of it in a **commercial** or **monetized** environment (including but not limited to paid ranks, donations, subscriptions, or access-based content) must first **obtain explicit permission** through the official **Mega Showdown Discord** server at:  
👉 [https://discord.gg/xH8WBTUs](https://discord.gg/xH8WBTUs)

This process is **simple and non-restrictive**, meant only to ensure that:

- The server operates transparently and ethically;
- No malicious, exploitative, or deceptive activities are associated with Mega Showdown content.

Any server found engaging in **shady, harmful, or unethical behavior** may be:

- **Blacklisted** from future updates and community access;
- **Banned** from using Mega Showdown assets or code;
- Have its **usage permissions revoked** permanently.

Permission may be reinstated at the discretion of **Yajat Kaul** or authorized representatives upon review.

### **1.3 Modification & Redistribution**

You are permitted to create and distribute **sidemods**—that is, separate modules, extensions, or addons that interact with Mega Showdown but do not contain substantial portions of its original code—without requesting permission, and such sidemods are **not bound** by this license, provided they do not include, copy, or heavily derive from Mega Showdown source files.

However, if your modification or derivative work includes **significant sections of code, logic, or structure** from the Mega Showdown Software—such as major systems, gameplay features, or internal components—then you must obtain **explicit written permission** from **Yajat Kaul** before distributing or publishing the work.

Redistribution of any portion of the original Mega Showdown Software, whether modified or unmodified, on public platforms (e.g., Modrinth, CurseForge) requires prior written approval, and must include:

- Clear credit to the original author(s), and
- An intact copy of this license file.

### **1.4 Texture/Asset Use**

All textures, models, animations, audio, and other visual or design assets that are original to and exclusively created for Mega Showdown are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)** license.

Under this license:

- You may **not** use these assets for any commercial purpose;
- You must **credit** the original authors when using or sharing these assets;
- If you remix, adapt, or build upon the assets, you must distribute your contributions under the **same license**;
- Redistribution outside of the Software must clearly state that they originate from **Mega Showdown** and include a link to this license.

Use of these assets in any context outside Mega Showdown must still comply with this license unless explicit written permission is granted by **Yajat Kaul**.
